          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.

      <h2 class="Title1">How does the web work?</h2>
    

      <div class="TextFormat Text1">
        <p>The web has four main components:</P>
          
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>You:</strong> You want to visit a web page

            <li>
              <strong>Your computer plus a Browser:</strong> Your browser makes a request via the internet
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The internet:</strong> Sends an HTTP request to a server
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Server:</strong> Locates appropriate HTML document and sends it back to your computer where your web browser interprets<br> the page and displays it on your computer screen
            </li>
          </ol>

      </div>

      <h2 class="Title1">What is a web page?</h2>
        <p class="TextFormat Text1">
          A web page is a document written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers read these documents, interpret and display them.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title1">What is HTML?</h2>
        <div class=" TextFormat Text1">
          <p>
            <b>HTML</b> (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is the heart of the web.
          </p>
          <p>HTML is made up of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Text content (What you see)</li>
              <li>Markup (What the text looks like)</li>

      <p>Basic HTML vocabulary you should know:</p>
  
      <!-- This information comes from:
      http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200508/html_tags_vs_elements_vs_attributes/ . I am 
      copying-rewording the explanation from that web page-->
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <b>Element:</b> A structure in HTML that consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tags:</b> Tags mark the beginning and end of an Element.  They are made of a less-than symbol, followed by the Element's name, followed by a greater-than symbol.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Attributes and values:</b>  Attributes follow tags and point to a value. Examples are images and links to other web pages
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em> Elements can be either <em><b>inline</b></em> (effecting just the text enclosed by tags), or <b>block</b>(block elements have an invisible box around them with height and width that separates them from any other element). While most Elements have both an <em><b>opening</b></em> and <em><b>closing</b></em> tag, some Elements use only one tag<br> and are referred to as <b>void.</b></em>
        </p>

      <h2 class="Title1">A Couple Other Points to Remember:</h2>
  
        <h3 class="Subtitle1">Computers are stupid</h3>
          <p class="TextFormat Text1">
            Why?  Because they interpret instruction literally.  If you use the wrong Element name in your opening tag or make a typo, a computer cannot "know" what you intended. A program will only work if the instructions are clear and the grammar correct.
         </p>
        <h3 class="Subtitle1">There Is Far Too Much to Remember</h3>
          <p class="TextFormat Text1">
            Don't try to memorize every single fact.  Instead, concentrate on understanding how programming languages work, and rely on the internet to remind you of an Element's name or a particular structure.

          <p >
            <strong>HTML:</strong> A Language with syntax and rules that provides the structure of the web page
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS: Provides</strong> the styles seen on the web page

          <p>
            <strong>Javascript:</strong> Allows actions/changes on the web page

          <p><strong>How to open Developer's Tools in Chrome:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Click on the symbol in the top right corner made of three lines (looks like a hamburger)
            </li>
            <li>Choose "More Tools" from the menu</li>
            <li>
              Choose "Developer Tools." A panel will open showing the structure of the web page you are on.  This is not the code, but how the browser interprets it.
            </li>
            <li>Click on the triangles to reveal hidden levels</li>
            <li>This is the Tree-like structure of HTML</li>
          </ol>
        </div> 
        <div class="TextFormat Text2">
          <p>
            For two good articles about Tree-like Structure, check out the following Wikipedia pages:
            <span class="ImageFormat">
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure" class="reference" >Tree Structure</a>

            </span>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Once you know the language, you can look at any HTML code and understand a great deal about how it will look as a web page.  Likewise, you can view any web page and know what the underlying code looks like.

        <div class="TextFormat Text2">
          <ul>
            <li>
             We organize code by determining the placement and size of the largest "boxes" first, and defining smaller and smaller boxes into those spaces.
            </li>
            <li>Every "box" is defined by the tag "div."</li>
            <li>"Divs" can be nestled endlessly within other "Divs."</li>

            </ul>
          <p>
           In this example, the word "class" is an attribute. It allows the user to add CSS style choices to every h1 element with the value "article."

        <h3 class="Subtitle3">First you need to link the CSS to your HTML:</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p><strong>Instuctions:</strong>:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Type &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</li>
              <li>Create &lt;head&gt; tabs</li>

      <h2 class="Title3"> What is CSS?</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">CSS = "Cascading Style Sheets"</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              <strong>Cascading </strong>refers to the process of moving from the most general property to the most specific property in your document.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>styles</strong> used in your project can be broken into separate CSS files or <strong>"sheets"</strong> to aid in organizing.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS properties, or rules, work in a hierarchy, much as laws function in a country:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Federal = Document wide rules: properties applied to the highest level &lt;div&gt; block
                </li>
                <li>State = Properties applied to sub &lt;div&gt; blocks</li>
                <li>Municipal = Properties applied to sub-sub &lt;div&gt; blocks</li>
                <li>Home = Properties applied to individual elements</li>
              </ol>
          </div>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">
          Cascading depends upon <em>INHERITANCE</em>:
        </h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              <em>INHERITANCE</em> means that a property assigned to an element will be applied to all its descendents (children), unless<br> overwritten by a more local property.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all propterties are heritable. Refer to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" class="reference">CSS reference</a> to find out whether a property is, or is not.
            /p>
          </div>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">To add a style choice, we create a <em>SELECTOR</em>:</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              The <em>SELECTOR</em> we choose will determine to which elements a particular style is applied.

        <div class="TextFormat Text3">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how it is displayed, not what kind of element it is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose type of element (tag) depending on what the element's purpose is.  That is, use a tag that matches function!
            </li>
            <li>When a tag changes, the box and the font can change as well</li>

      <h2 class="Title3">Understanding the Box Model</h2>

            <ol>
             <li>Margin</li>
              <li>Border</li>
              <li>Padding</li>
              <li>Content</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can see an element's box in Dev Tools by clicking the Computed tab</p>
          </div>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">
          At the center of this box is the <strong>Content</strong>.
        </h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <ul>
              <li>The image or text that appears on the website</li>
              <li>
                Consider the content the nucleus: It sits at the center and the surrouding layers protect it, so that other items don't overlap it or sit too close, making the website visually unappealing.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Next is the <strong>Padding</strong>.</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <ul>
              <li>The Padding clears the area around the Content.</li>
              <li>It is affected by the background-color of the box </li>
              <li>Think of it as the space inside the box that protects the Content directly.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Next is the <strong>Border</strong>.</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <ul>
              <li>The Border goes around both the Padding and the Content</li>
              <li>It is inherited from the color property of the box. </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">
          Last, the out layer is the <strong>Margin</strong>.
        </h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <ul>
              <li>The Margin clears an area around the Border</li>
              <li>It has no background-color.  It is completely transparent. </li>
              <li>Think of it as the space between boxes </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">Calculating Box Size</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Default = Sum of Border, Padding and Content</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              To make the calculation easier, we put the following code into our CSS file:
            </p>
              <ol>
               <li>* { </li>
                <li>box-sizing: border-box;</li>
                <li> } </li>
              </ol>
            <p>
              Now, the calculation of the box includes both the border and the padding, so that it's easier to make layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              You just set the width of the overall box, and no matter how you tweak the padding and border layers, the size of the box will always stay the same.
            </p>
            <p>The CSS must include browser-specific prefixes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;</li>
                <li>-moz-box-sizing: border-box; </li>
                <li>-ms-box-sizing: border-box </li>
                <li>box-sizing: border-box</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              You can set the size of your box layers in pixels or in percentages:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>% changes the box as the screen size changes</li>
                <li>
                  Pixel sets the image to one size, regardless of device. This can lead to a bad user experience
                </li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              You can set max-width, so that an element can get smaller, but not larger than a set value.  Max-width won't change layout.
            </p>
          </div>
    </div>

      <h2 class="Title3">Positioning Elements</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">This is a complicated concept</h3>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Let's look at one display property: flex.</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              Flex allows you to layout a line and distribute space among items in a container, or div.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tag "div" is set, by default, to use the entire width of a page 
            </p>
            <p>
              Flex overrides this behavior to allow divs to appear next to each other.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2 class="Title3">Dev Tools</h2>
        <h3 class="Subtitle3">Developer Tools can help speed up projects</h3>
          <div class="TextFormat Text3">
            <p>
              By first testing changes in Dev Tools, you can easily see whether a particular change is advantageous.
            </p>
            <p> Use an-online code validator to locate code errors.</p>
            <p>
              Once validated, you can place icons on your webpage as proof that your webpage complies with standards.

            <p>
              Machine language:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Written in numbers; the only language the computer really understands
                </li>
                <li>
                  Platform specific.  Machine language cannot be used on different kinds of computers.
                </li>
                <li>The fastest language to process</li>
              </ol>
            <p>
              Assembly language:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                 Uses the same instructions as in Machine Language, but keywords and variables have names rather than numbers only, making it easier to read and write.
                </li>
                <li>Like machine language, it is platform specific</li>
                <li>
                  Assembly language must be translated into the machine language of a CPU by a program called an assembler.
                </li>
                <li>Very fast language to process</li>
              </ol>
            <p>
              High Level Language:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The closest to human language, it is easier to read, write and maintain.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Platform independent: it can be used on any platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Must be put through an interpreter or a compiler that translates the human-like language into the machine language of numbers.
                </li>
                <li>Slower language to process</li>
              </ol>

            It's the closest to human language, so easy to use that it's been called "programming at the speed of thought." Python programs are shorter and take less time to create than programs in many other popular languages.<!-- Dawson, Michael.

            Python can be integrated with other languages such as C, C++ and Java.  This means that a programmer can take advatage of work already done in another language while using Python.  It also means that the strengths of other languages, such as the extra speed that C or C++ might offer.<!-- Dawson, Michael.
